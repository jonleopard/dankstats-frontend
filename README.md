# dankstats-frontend

This is the frontend for dankstats, which talks to the dankstats-api.

#### Developing

To start the project in development mode, run `make dev`. To build, run `make
build`.

Make sure to you create the docker image with `make create` before running the
`make up` command from the dankstats-api repo. I will make this cleaner in the
future.
